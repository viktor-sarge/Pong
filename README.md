# PONG + ENGINE

Started making Pong, ended up having fun making abstractions.

Currently I'm refactoring general things out into an engine residing in it's own folder. Game specific classes and logic is kept in the game folder.

No build system, no frameworks, no depencencies, no setup, no backend. Not even Typescript actually. That will likely change. Howler is currently used through CDN for example and Typescript would be nice.

Currently serving it locally in dev with "live-server" on my terminal.

I'm updating as long as feature creep and "what if" feels entertaining.
