# PONG + ENGINE

Started making Pong, ended up having fun making abstractions.

Currently I'm refactoring general things out into an engine residing in it's own folder. Game specific classes and logic is kept in the game folder.

No build system, no frameworks, no depencencies, no setup, no backend. Not even Typescript actually. That will likely change. Howler is currently used through CDN for example and Typescript would be nice.

Currently serving it locally in dev with "live-server" on my terminal.

I'm updating as long as feature creep and "what if" feels entertaining.

- [**engine**](engine) - Reusable abstractions for audio, input, collisions, physics, particles, GUI, messages, and gameloop.
    - [**objects**](engine/objects) - Making collision detection easy by offering two standard objects: circle and rectangle. Each with relevant variables and both extend baseEntity.js that keeps coordinates.
    - [**particles**](engine/particles) - The particle system. Allow you to add particle emitters via the engine.
        - [**classes**](engine/particles/classes) - A basic particle emitter using the particle class.
- [**game**](game) - All files for the game
    - [**audio**](game/audio) - Audio assets
    - [**config**](game/config) - Game config as JSON
    - [**css**](game/css)
    - [**data**](game/data) - Text strings as JSON
    - [**fonts**](game/fonts)
    - [**js**](game/js) - All game related code for Pong
        - [**helpers**](game/js/helpers)
        - [**objects**](game/js/objects) - Game specific classes like ball, paddle, scoreboard
